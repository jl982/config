sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi
sudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1


I think that tells us that the iwlwifi driver isn't ready for N speeds; I suppose that if the router is trying to negotiate an N connection and the card can't do it, the card gives up and does nothing. One thing I do know is it's better to work than not work!!

To make this persistent, please do:
sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf

A new empty file will open. Add one line:
options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1
