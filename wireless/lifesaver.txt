sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi
sudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1


I think that tells us that the iwlwifi driver isn't ready for N speeds; I suppose that if the router is trying to negotiate an N connection and the card can't do it, the card gives up and does nothing. One thing I do know is it's better to work than not work!!

To make this persistent, please do:
sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf

A new empty file will open. Add one line:
options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1


deauthenticating by local choice reason 3
#1
killall wpa_supplicant (network manager should spawn another one)
#2
apt-get remove network-manager
(kill wpa_supplicant too)
ifdown wlan0
ifup wlan0
#3
disable ipv6
#4
/etc/init.d/NetworkManager stop
/etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant stop
After this, you will be able to ru nyour own wpa connection command with no fear of being deauthenticated by local choice due to the rogue daemon:
wpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan0 -c[WPA conf file path]
Then obtain network specific credentials and you'll be off and runings:
dhclient wlan0
